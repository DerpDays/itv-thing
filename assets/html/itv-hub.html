                <h1>Cornation Street</h1>
                As secrets and lies threaten to explode on the cobbles, 2017 looks set to bring lots more drama for the residents of Coronation Street.
                Leanne is shocked when she finally discovers the real reason for sister Toyah’s return to Weatherfield, but she has bigger problems to deal with as her baby’s due date grows closer and the secret that both she and Steve are hiding – the fact that he is the real father of her child as well as wife Michelle’s – is a ticking time bomb ready to explode.
                Phelan seems to have everyone where he wants them as the New Year begins, but one person who is still oblivious to his dastardly dealings is the soon to be Mrs Phelan. Will Pat make an honest woman of Eileen – and more importantly will she make an honest man of him?
                As life calms down at the Platts and Sarah settles into her relationship with Gary, Bethany finds herself charmed by a handsome older man. Still feeling raw over her unrequited crush on Gary, what is she letting herself in for, and is there more to Nathan than meets the eye?
                Sophie lands back on the cobbles and, along with her holiday souvenirs, she has also brought back a surprise visitor for Sally and Kevin – big sister Rosie. On the surface it looks like Rosie has been living the high life in the States, but all is not what it seems as yet again Rosie brings a whole load of trouble to the Websters’ door.
                Tensions run high in the Barlow household as Ken’s children and grandchildren jostle for position. The boys soon have hearts fluttering and while Daniel may not be the one with the reputation as a ladies man, when he sets his sights on one local girl, it appears he may be the real heartbreaker.
                Elsewhere, as Jenny establishes herself as queen bee at Underworld, she is shocked to discover exactly what Aidan has been up to. Is his secret fling with Maria about to be exposed? And tongues are set wagging when Billy brings troubled Shona to the street.

                <h1>I'm A Celebrity</h1>
                The award-winning audience favourite I’m A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here! is back which can mean only one thing... the time has come for a brand new cast of celebrities to head down under and battle it out in TV’s toughest challenge.
                Leaving their plush pads and luxuries far behind, our celebrity campers will spend up to three weeks taking on the harsh surroundings of the Australian jungle, with a whole host of brand new nasty surprises created just for them as they battle for the title of King or Queen of the Jungle. They’ll be living and working together every day. Personalities clash and unlikely new friendships are formed. They’ll be eating live insects, having cockroaches crawl over them and entering a swamp full of crocodiles.
                Only the star who can endure the trials and win the hearts of the public will be awarded the jungle crown.
